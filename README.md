# ADVENT OF CODE 2023 WRITE UP

This is my personal solution for the 2023 puzzles of Advent of code. All scripts run in commandline.

To execute the code, follow these steps:

1. Make sure both NodeJS and NPM are installed *(NodeJS does't come with NPM pre-packed on every OS)*
2. Clone the git repository
3. Open a commandline and open the folder of the cloned repository.
4. Run `npm install` and let all the dependencies install themselves.
5. Run `npm run main` to start the program. Follow the documentation below to figure out how to use it.

This years advent of code has two puzzles for each day. The current amount of days in the repository is `4`. Every day has both challenges completed.
To run a specific challenge, first enter the day for which you want to run a challenge for. After that, enter either `1` or `2` to run the script for the specific challenge. The result will be printed as a console log.

**The input is stored in a text file which is saved in each days folder. If you need to replace the input, you need to do that manually.**
